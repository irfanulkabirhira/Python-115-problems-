# 72. Set Difference: Given two sets A and B, write a Python program to find the difference between set A and set B (i.e., elements present in A but not in B) and print the result.



# Define sets A and B
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# Find the difference between sets A and B (elements in A but not in B)
difference = A - B

# Print the result
print("Difference (A - B):", difference)
